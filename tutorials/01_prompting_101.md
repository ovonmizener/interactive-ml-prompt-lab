# Prompt Engineering 101: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective inputs for large language models (LLMs) to get the desired outputs. This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of prompt engineering and how to use the Interactive ML & Prompting Playground to experiment with different techniques.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves designing and optimizing the text inputs (prompts) that you give to language models to achieve specific, desired outputs. It's like learning to "speak" the language that AI models understand best.

### Key Concepts

- **Prompt**: The input text you provide to an LLM
- **Completion**: The output text generated by the LLM
- **Token**: The basic unit of text that models process
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in the output (0 = deterministic, 1 = very random)
- **Top-p**: Controls diversity by limiting token selection

## Basic Prompting Techniques

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting means giving the model a task without any examples.

**Example:**
```
Classify the sentiment of this text: "I love this product! It's amazing."
```

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting provides examples to help the model understand the task.

**Example:**
```
Text: "This movie was terrible."
Sentiment: Negative

Text: "I enjoyed the concert."
Sentiment: Positive

Text: "The weather is okay."
Sentiment: Neutral

Text: "I love this product! It's amazing."
Sentiment:
```

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to show its reasoning process.

**Example:**
```
Let's solve this step by step:

Problem: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed?

Step 1: I need to find the average speed
Step 2: Average speed = total distance / total time
Step 3: Total distance = 120 miles
Step 4: Total time = 2 hours
Step 5: Average speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour

Answer: The train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Role-Based Prompting

Assign a specific role to the model to get more focused responses.

**Example:**
```
You are an expert data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning. 
Please explain the concept of overfitting in simple terms.
```

### 2. System Messages

Use system messages to set the context and behavior of the model.

**Example:**
```
System: You are a helpful AI assistant that provides accurate, well-researched answers.

User: What are the benefits of machine learning?
```

### 3. Structured Output

Request specific output formats to make responses more usable.

**Example:**
```
Analyze the following text and provide your response in JSON format:

Text: "The new AI model achieved 95% accuracy on the test set."

Please provide:
{
  "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "key_points": ["point1", "point2"],
  "summary": "brief summary"
}
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**Bad:**
```
Tell me about AI
```

**Good:**
```
Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning, 
focusing on their applications in computer vision.
```

### 2. Provide Context

**Bad:**
```
Write a story
```

**Good:**
```
Write a 300-word science fiction story about a robot discovering emotions 
for the first time. The story should be suitable for young adults and 
include dialogue between the robot and a human character.
```

### 3. Use Examples

When possible, provide examples of the desired output format.

**Example:**
```
Generate product descriptions for these items:

Item: Wireless Headphones
Description: Experience crystal-clear sound with these premium wireless headphones. 
Featuring noise cancellation and 30-hour battery life.

Item: Smart Watch
Description: [Your description here]
```

### 4. Iterate and Refine

Prompt engineering is iterative. Start with a basic prompt and refine it based on the results.

## Common Prompt Patterns

### 1. Analysis Prompts

```
Analyze the following [text/data] and provide:
1. Key insights
2. Potential issues
3. Recommendations
4. Next steps
```

### 2. Comparison Prompts

```
Compare and contrast [A] and [B] in terms of:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Use cases
- Pros and cons
```

### 3. Problem-Solving Prompts

```
Let's solve this problem step by step:

Problem: [Describe the problem]

Step 1: [First step]
Step 2: [Second step]
...
Solution: [Final answer]
```

### 4. Creative Writing Prompts

```
Write a [type of content] about [topic] that includes:
- [Element 1]
- [Element 2]
- [Element 3]

Style: [Describe the desired style]
Length: [Specify length]
```

## Using the Interactive ML & Prompting Playground

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Prompt Workbench**: Use the sidebar to access the prompt engineering interface.

2. **Choose a Template**: Select from predefined templates or create a custom one.

3. **Customize Variables**: Fill in the template variables with your specific content.

4. **Select Model**: Choose the LLM model you want to use.

5. **Adjust Parameters**: Set temperature, max tokens, and other parameters.

6. **Generate Response**: Click "Generate Response" to see the results.

### Analyzing Results

- **Token Analysis**: View token usage and distribution
- **Response Metrics**: Check response length, quality, and relevance
- **Prompt Variations**: Generate and test different prompt versions
- **History**: Save and compare different prompts and responses

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Vague Prompts

**Problem:** Unclear instructions lead to irrelevant responses.
**Solution:** Be specific about what you want and how you want it.

### 2. Overly Complex Prompts

**Problem:** Too many instructions confuse the model.
**Solution:** Break complex tasks into simpler, focused prompts.

### 3. Ignoring Context

**Problem:** Not providing enough context for the model to understand the task.
**Solution:** Include relevant background information and examples.

### 4. Not Iterating

**Problem:** Using the first prompt without refinement.
**Solution:** Test multiple versions and improve based on results.

## Token Management

### Understanding Tokens

- Tokens are the basic units of text that models process
- Different models have different token limits
- Token usage affects cost and performance

### Optimizing Token Usage

1. **Remove Unnecessary Words**: Keep prompts concise
2. **Use Abbreviations**: When appropriate and clear
3. **Batch Requests**: Combine related queries
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track token consumption

### Token Limits by Model

- GPT-3.5-turbo: 4,096 tokens
- GPT-4: 8,192 tokens
- GPT-4-turbo: 128,000 tokens
- Claude-3: 200,000 tokens
